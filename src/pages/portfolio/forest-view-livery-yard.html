						<h3>Re-design and development</h3>
						<p>One of my last projects before I left Suite Creative in 2015 was to transfer and re-design an old non-responsive site onto the WordPress platform. Forest View was an pre-existing client of Suite Creative and it had gotten to the point where their website was no longer suitable for purpose anymore. As the client had requested the ability to edit the information on the website herself, WordPress was the ideal solution.</p>

						<p>The colour scheme remained the same for the project but the layout and structure was all completely new. The site was updated with large beautiful imagery of the horses and a contact form was also added for customers to get in contact.</p>

						<p>When it came to completing the project the client was extremely happy with the final outcome and agreed it was a much-needed refresh.</p>

						<h3>SEO Updates</h3>
						<p>As an additional step to this project, some light SEO work was also carried out using the SEO WordPress plugin, “Yoast SEO”. This plugin allowed me to fine tune meta descriptions and other ranking factors so that I was able to rank #1 for the term “livery yard east Grinstead” which was great.</p>
