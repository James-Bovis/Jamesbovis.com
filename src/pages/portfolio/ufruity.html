						<p>While I was employed at Suite Creative, one of the tasks I worked on was for their sister company, Ufruity. The owners wanted a complete overhaul of their website and one that would reflect the new direction they wanted to take the company in.</p>

						<h3>Moving to WordPress</h3>
						<p>As the company were changing their business structure and services, the owners thought it was time to move the website over from just static HTML and CSS, to the WordPress platform.</p>

						<p>It was my responsibility to handle the websites transition over to WordPress and to also design a new look and feel.</p>

						<p>One of the many benefits of WordPress is its flexibility and ease of use. By using it, it gave the owners (and anyone else) a really easy way of updating and adding more content to the website.</p>

						<h3>Design overhaul</h3>
						<p>Before the redesign, the previous website was unresponsive, inconsistent and not inline with the direction Ufruity wanted to move forward in. So, it was decided that the website should provide a clean user experience, showcase Ufruityâ€™s work effectively, be fully responsive and remain in line with their branding and ethos.</p>

						<p>After a few iterations of designs and ideas, the finished website featured clean header images and captions, on brand SVG icons, smooth, attention-grabbing transitions and a simple way to show off the work they have produced for their clients.</p>

						<p>The site also performed well and looked great on any device it was previewed on.</p>

						<p>Overall, I was really happy with the outcome and it was a great feeling to know that the company owners were pleased with it too.</p>
