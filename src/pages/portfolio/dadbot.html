						<h3>The Idea</h3>
						<p>Dad jokes have been a staple of the internet since it began, with sites like Reddit and dedicated Facebook pages sharing some of the best, I thought people should be a “Hello” away from their own personal dad joke curator. I knew the bot needed to be simple, be personal and witty, otherwise users wouldn’t keep asking for jokes and simply leave.</p>

						<p>So, I wrote Dad Bot’s script with humour and personality in mind including some mild easter eggs should someone ever come across them. With added GIF replies and using the user's name, I was able to write a human-like bot which users enjoy interacting with.</p>

						<h3>Execution</h3>
						<p>To get DadBot published and active inside Facebook Messenger, I used an excellent website called <a href="">Dexter</a> to write and publish my bot. The service is built on a film script-like design which the bot creator types out users responses and the bots answers in a linear, timeline approach.</p>

						<p>Writing the script was super easy with Dexter and not long after, I had a fully interactive bot that users could start talking to.</p>

						<p>DadBot’s jokes are sadly not written by me, but they are pulled from a <a href="https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api">dad joke API</a> (I know, I was surprised to find one too). Luckily, Dexter provides API fetch support and once I wrote the request properly, DadBot was fetching jokes no problem.</p>

						<h3>Website &amp; Launch</h3>
						<p>Once I was happy with DadBot’s linguistic abilities, I moved on to create an enticing and functional landing page for people to visit outside of Facebook Messenger.</p>

						<p>After finding a really excellent jQuery plugin which emulates a Facebook Messenger conversation and quickly assembling a Bootstrap based landing page - I was good to go.</p>

						<p>Soon after the website was finished, I launched DadBot on Facebook Messenger. Since it’s launch, DadBot has sent over <strong>14,000 messages</strong> to over <strong>400</strong> Facebook users all over the globe. It is a really great feeling to see people interacting with the product, getting messages back and asking for even more!</p>

						<p>My goals are to continue improving DadBot with even more witty responses and flesh out his GIF replies to hopefully bring more joy to the over 1 Billion Facebook users out there.</p>
