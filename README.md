## About James Bovis
Hi, I'm James and I am a Front-End developer currentlly working in London.

Web Design and the Internet run through my veins. Whether it’s my current position as a Front-End Developer for [PawSquad](http://pawsquad.com), listening to one of my [Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/1178661039/playlist/3HzMbBUyI0XqA1rM8magu5) or posting my latest photograph to my followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fenderjim/), I’m always online.

I’m pretty good and creating things for the web too. Some of these include self-teaching myself HTML & CSS, building my own [Facebook Bot](http://dadbot.xyz) (Go and say ‘Hi’), competency in SASS, GIT and I’m a wiz inside the Adobe Creative Suite too.

While I’m offline, I love catching up on the latest blockbuster, brewing coffee, playing guitar and catching up with friends.
